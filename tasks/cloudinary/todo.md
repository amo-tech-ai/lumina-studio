## Final verdict

| # | Question | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Overall Cloudinary readiness** | **72 / 100** — ingest + identity proven on prod; operator upload path and legacy data debt remain |
| 2 | **Cloudinary works locally?** | **Yes** — 48 webhook + 47 pipeline + 1456 full tests + build green; lint OOM is infra-only |
| 3 | **Production works end-to-end?** | **Partial yes** — webhook identity + delete archive proven via direct upload; **not** via upload-sign + live script |
| 4 | **PR #421 fully deployed?** | **Yes** — merged and on prod SHA `ea91bd5` |
| 5 | **PR #425 required or optional?** | **Required and deployed** — overwrite/rename hardening already on prod |
| 6 | **IPI-641 can be marked Done?** | **Conditionally yes** — Linear already Done; forensic gate says **hold follow-up** until upload-sign Bearer fix + backfill decision + optional live script green |
| 7 | **Critical fixes (priority)** | 1) upload-sign brand auth (Bearer + org membership) 2) Legacy provider-id backfill decision 3) IPI-433 upload UI 4) Lint OOM / scoped lint 5) Rename Console trigger (post-spike) |
| 8 | **Execution plan to 100%** | See below |

---

## Execution plan to 100%

```text
Immediate
  1. Fix POST /api/assets/upload-sign brand ownership:
     use resolveOperatorUser Bearer session for Supabase query OR is_org_member(org_id)
  2. Re-run npm run verify:cloudinary-webhook-live against https://www.ipix.co (qa brand db1f728d…)
  3. Record backfill decision: forward-only vs Admin backfill for 5 null mirrors + fashionos orphans
  4. Scoped lint fix or CI memory bump

Next (product)
  5. IPI-433 — CldUploadWidget + poll Supabase ready (brand-only)
  6. IPI-435 — listAssets filters / URL state (parallel OK)
  7. IPI-642 — document server CLOUDINARY_* in .env.example

Later
  8. Rename spike → Console trigger or app uploader.rename + DB write
  9. SHOOT-ARCH-002 shoot folder → brand resolution
 10. Fashionos orphan cleanup / archive
 11. Realtime only if IPI-281 gallery requires it
```

---

## Do now / Next / Later (checklist)

### Do now
- [ ] Fix upload-sign Bearer + org brand ownership (blocks live script + IPI-433)
- [ ] Re-run `verify:cloudinary-webhook-live` to green on prod
- [ ] Record legacy backfill decision (5 null provider ids)

### Next
- [ ] **IPI-433** — brand-only `CldUploadWidget` + poll
- [ ] **IPI-435** — extend `listAssets` (parallel OK)
- [ ] **IPI-642** — server Cloudinary env docs
- [ ] Docs commit — IPI-524 ADR onto main

### Later
- [ ] Rename spike (A app vs B webhook) — issue only after path chosen
- [ ] Create SHOOT-ARCH-002 when scheduling shoot ingest
- [ ] IPI-638 · IPI-637 · approval chain · IPI-281

### Not now
- Rename webhook ticket as automatic P0 · Realtime for `/app/assets` · duplicate backfill tickets

### Category grades

| Category | Score | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| MVP sequencing (433→435→436) | **92** | Correct; upload-sign fix is implicit P0 |
| Approval chain (441→639→437) | **88** | Correct order; nothing shipped yet |
| Infra tickets (637/638) | **58** | Over-prioritized vs current prod proof |
| Shoot taxonomy (184/643/645) | **72** | Work largely done; tickets not updated |
| Export / advanced (640/448/447) | **85** | Correctly deferred |
| Scope discipline | **90** | Issues rewritten to avoid duplicate systems |

### Best-practices todos (Cloudinary + Supabase)

- [ ] **Signed upload only** — keep `ipix-signed-upload` (`unsigned:false`, `type:authenticated`); never expose API secret ([upload presets](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_presets))
- [ ] **Widget over custom uploader** — IPI-433 must use `CldUploadWidget` / next-cloudinary, not bespoke upload UI
- [ ] **Ready = Supabase** — poll `cloudinary_assets.status=ready`; never treat widget `onSuccess` as library-ready
- [ ] **Global triggers additive** — MCP confirms `additive:true` on upload/delete; keep preset free of conflicting `notification_url` ([notifications](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/notifications))
- [ ] **Verify notification signatures** — `X-Cld-Timestamp` replay window + `verifyNotificationSignature` (already in webhook)
- [ ] **Supabase SoT** — authz, approval, search, audit in Postgres; Cloudinary for delivery/transform only
- [ ] **RLS before Realtime** — do not publish `assets` until SHOOT-ARCH-002 + org isolation proof ([RLS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security))
- [ ] **Append-only audit** — `asset_events` table, not JSONB history arrays (IPI-441)
- [ ] **Delete with invalidate** — Admin destroy uses `invalidate:true`; soft-delete UI (440) must not move assets to Cloudinary trash folder
- [ ] **upload-sign org auth** — brand check must use Bearer session + `is_org_member`, not cookie-only + `brands.user_id`
- [ ] **Legacy backfill decision** — 5/6 mirrors still null provider id; record forward-only vs Admin backfill
- [ ] **Env docs (IPI-642)** — document `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_NOTIFICATION_API_SECRET` server-only

Step 0   Fix upload-sign org auth (bundle into IPI-433 PR)

Wave 1   IPI-433 ∥ IPI-435 ∥ IPI-642     — operator upload foundation

Wave 2   IPI-436                          — asset detail workspace

Wave 3   IPI-441 → IPI-639 → IPI-437 → IPI-438   — approval + audit chain

Wave 4   IPI-638 → IPI-440                — drift report, then Trash

Later    IPI-444, IPI-439, IPI-640, IPI-448, IPI-637, IPI-434,
         IPI-281 (needs SHOOT-ARCH-002), IPI-80
```

**Immediate rule:** Complete one real app upload (IPI-433), confirm it appears in library (IPI-435), before opening advanced Cloudinary work.

### Foundation complete (do not rebuild)

| Issue | Status |
| --- | --- |
| IPI-430 CLD-000 | 🟢 Complete |
| IPI-636 CLD-WEBHOOK-001 | 🟢 Complete — prod webhook proven |
| IPI-641 CLD-ID-001 | 🟢 Complete |
| IPI-643 SHOOT-DATA-002A | 🟢 Complete — 49 rows |
| IPI-645 SHOOT-DATA-002B | 🟢 Complete — lookupShotReferences |

### Active status corrections

| Issue | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPI-433 | 🔴 P0 | Main blocker — upload-sign org auth |
| IPI-435 | 🟡 Partial | listAssets exists; filters/URL state pending |
| IPI-638 | 🟡 Narrow | Delete works; drift report only |
| IPI-637 | ⚪ Deferred | Until metrics justify inbox |
| IPI-281 | 🔴 Blocked | IPI-433 + SHOOT-ARCH-002 |

### Roadmap score (final validated — v4 audit)

| Area | Score |
| --- | ---: |
| Dependency accuracy | 98/100 |
| MVP focus | 98/100 |
| Scope efficiency | 97/100 |
| Production sequencing | 97/100 |
| Over-engineering risk | 96/100 |
| **Overall** | **97/100** |

| Issue audit | Score |
| --- | ---: |
| IPI-433 CLD-101 | 92/100 — ready to implement |
| IPI-435 CLD-102 | 93/100 — blocker fix applied |
| IPI-281 SHOOT-AI-004A | 95/100 — phased A→D |

**Next execution target:** IPI-433 (upload-sign org auth + widget + poll by `cloudinary_asset_id`) → verify upload appears in IPI-435 library.

### SHOOT-ARCH-002 (deferred — create when gallery scheduled)

Scope when created:

- Resolve `shoot_id` during upload or ingestion
- Persist asset-to-shoot relationship
- Enforce org + brand ownership
- Prove one uploaded asset appears under correct shoot
- **No** Realtime · **no** gallery UI

### Wave 1 blocker fix (2026-07-18 v4)

- **IPI-433 does NOT block IPI-435** — parallel development; verification dependency only
- **IPI-433 blocks IPI-436 + IPI-281** (wave completion / shoot foundation)
- **IPI-435 blocks IPI-436** (library filters first)

### Per-task efficiency cheat sheet

| Issue | Most efficient path | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **433** | `CldUploadWidget` → existing sign route → poll Supabase | Custom uploader, Realtime, backend queue table |
| **435** | Extend `listAssets` + URL params on indexed columns | Cloudinary Search API, new search route |
| **436** | Reuse AssetCard + one signed preview | Six channel previews, relationship graph |
| **441** | One append-only migration + webhook writes | JSONB history, event-sourcing framework |
| **639** | Extend `cloudinary_assets.approval`; migration-only PR | Duplicate approval in Cloudinary |
| **437** | Brand-scoped queue; bind exact version | Media Library embed, approve by public_id |
| **638** | Dashboard SQL drift report → optional script | Rebuild delete webhook |
| **637** | Wait for 503 metrics; Postgres inbox before Queues | Queues before product upload ships |
| **642** | Single `.env.example` docs PR | Monitoring platform, R2 mirror |
| **434** | Widget `multiple` / `upload_large` when needed | Custom chunk protocol |
| **440** | Soft-delete columns + 30d purge Cron | Cloudinary trash folder |
| **448/640** | Named transforms + archive API + manifest rows | Browser ZIP as SoT |
| **281** | One query + one Realtime sub after SHOOT-ARCH-002 | Realtime on library; second assets UI |
